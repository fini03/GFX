As programmers, we would like to be able to specify any color that can be stored in the framebuffer. For our 24-bit example, there are 224 possible colors, sometimes referred to as 16M colors, where M denotes 10242 . Other systems may have as many as 12 (or more) bits per color or as few as 4 bits per color. Because our API should be independent of the particulars of the hardware, we would like to specify a color independently of the number of bits in the framebuffer and to let the drivers and hardware match our specification as closely as possible to the available display. A natural technique is to use the color cube and to specify color components as numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 denotes the maximum (or saturated value) of the corresponding primary, and 0.0 denotes a zero value of that primary.
